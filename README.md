# Titanic-Disaster-Prediction_ML

## Specifying the Data Analytic Question
DATASET 1 : Predict the number of Survivors in Titanic Disaster based on train and test datasets

DATASET 2 : Predict whether an Email is a Spam or Not

## Metric for Success
Confusion matrix, Create a classification Report, Compute an Accuarecy score of 80%

## Understanding the context

DATASET 1

comprise of passenger's information that was captured in the Titanic Disaster. The information about those who survived and those who didn't survive. The Ones that survived are denoted as 1 while those who died denoted by 0. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle.

DATASET 2:

This dataset has different messages and we are tasked to predict whether an email is a spam or not. The was sourced from Kaggle
## Experimental Design
Data mungling
Exploratory Data Analysis

Classifing Model
K Nearest Neighbor
Naive Bayes
Create a confusion matrix
Create a classification Report that will show
* Recall
* Precesion
* fi score
* Support
* Accuarcy
